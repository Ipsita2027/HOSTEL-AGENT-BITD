# Hostel-Agent 🏨🤖

Hostel-Agent is an intelligent assistant designed to help hostel residents quickly access information through natural language queries.  
The project is currently focused on **food menu queries**, with a clear roadmap to support additional hostel-related information in the future.

  - Users can ask natural language questions related to hostel food menus
  - Backend processes the intent and returns structured results
- ✅ **LLM-assisted query understanding**
- ✅ **Backend API for structured responses**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB**
- REST-based API architecture

### Frontend
- **Streamlit (Python)** — *temporary UI for rapid prototyping*

> ⚠️ Note: The frontend is currently implemented in Streamlit for fast iteration.  
> In later versions, it may be migrated to **Angular** or **React** for a more scalable and production-ready UI.

## 🔐 Authentication (Coming Soon)

- Authentication and authorization are **not yet implemented**
- Planned features:
  - User authentication
  - Role-based access (e.g., student, admin)

The system is intentionally designed to be **extensible**.  
Future supported query types may include:

- 📜 **Rules & Regulations**
- 📞 **Contact Information**

These will be added incrementally without changing the core architecture.
